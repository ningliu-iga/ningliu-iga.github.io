I am a Machine Learning Scientist with over six years of experience developing and applying novel neural architectures and graph-based models to accelerate numerical simulation and discover next-generation design, with interest and relevant work in neural operator learning, large language models (transformer and mamba), meta learning, disentangled/causal representation learning, and generative models.

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, advised by [Dr. Ann E. Jeffers](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/jeffers-ann/), and I am actively collaborating with [Dr. Yue Yu](https://www.lehigh.edu/~yuy214/) at Lehigh University. I also obtained two M.S. degrees in Mechanical Enigneering and Civil Engineering, both from the University of Michigan. I have always enjoyed doing cutting-edge researches in ML. My work has been published in top-tier conference venues such as ICML, NeurIPS, and AISTATS.

Welcome to drop me an email if you want to discuss or collaborate!
