I am a Machine Learning Scientist with 7 years of experience developing and deploying innovative machine learning solutions at scale to address challenges in LLM post-training, reasoning and build agentic solutions, as well as advancing next-generation design in complex physics-based scenarios. I have a strong focus on LLMs and attention-based foundation models, generative models, meta learning, disentangled/causal representation learning, and neural operator learning.

I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, and am actively collaborating with researchers across academia. Prior to joining Amazon, I was a Principal Machine Learning Scientist at Global Engineering & Materials, Inc. I am passionate about advancing the field of machine learning, and my work has been published in top-tier conference venues such as ICML, NeurIPS, and AISTATS.

Hit me up if you are interested in discussing or exploring potential collaboration opportunities!
