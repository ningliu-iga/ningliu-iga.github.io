I am a Machine Learning Scientist with 6+ years of experience developing and deploying novel machine learning solutions at scale to address complex physics-based challenges and discover next-generation design, with interest and relevant work in large language models and attention-based foundation models, generative models, meta learning, disentangled/causal representation learning, and neural operator learning.

I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, advised by [Dr. Ann E. Jeffers](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/jeffers-ann/), and am actively collaborating with [Dr. Yue Yu](https://www.lehigh.edu/~yuy214/) at Lehigh University. Additionally, I hold dual M.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering, both from the University of Michigan. I am passionate about advancing the field of machine learning, and my work has been published in top-tier conference venues such as ICML, NeurIPS, and AISTATS.

Hit me up if you are interested in discussing or exploring potential collaboration opportunities!
